# Gateway

This is a minimally configured Spring Cloud Gateway. It currently points /users and /lists to a User-Service and /posts and /comments to a Post-Service. You will need to update it if you want to add new services, routes, or more advanced features like circuit-breaking. 

To run the gateway, clone https://github.com/Revature-Reverse/Gateway.git, open it in the IDE of your choice, and run the project.
